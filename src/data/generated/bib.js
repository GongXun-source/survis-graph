        "abstract": "The variation in the distributions of recorded data between individuals leads to low classification accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal fusion convolutional neural network (MFCNN). This network extracts common information from surface electromyography (sEMG) and accelerometer signals of different subjects using a two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN). To enhance the classification accuracy of a particular subject, a fine-tuning approach was implemented. The performance of the proposed method was assessed in four different scenarios, which include intersubject classification, intersubject classification when training data from multiple subjects, fine-tuned intersubject classification, and fine-tuned intersubject classification when training data from multiple subjects. The results demonstrate that in the intersubject scenario, when multiple subjects are available for training, the MFCNN achieves higher classification accuracy ( ${p} < 0.05$ ) than other neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs) that use sEMG signals [neural network (NN) and SVM], accelerometer signals (accNN and accSVM), sEMG and accelerometer signals [multimodal fusion nerual network (MFNN) and multimodal fusion support vector machine (MFSVM)] as inputs, as well as a CNN that uses sEMG signals as input after fine-tuning. Furthermore, compared with an MFCNN model trained with data from a single subject and an accCNN model trained with data from a single subject or multiple subjects, an MFCNN trained with multiple subjects demonstrated better performance on new subjects after fine-tuning ( ${p} < 0.05$ ). This method can learn common features among different subjects and improve the performance of classification among subjects. Our proposed method demonstrates the innovation of using a multimodal fusion approach and two-stream CNN to improve intersubject classification accuracy in upper limb movements.",

        "abstract": "The surface electromyography (sEMG)-based gesture recognition with deep learning approach plays an increasingly important role in human-computer interaction. Existing deep learning architectures are mainly based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which captures spatial information of electromyogram signal. Motivated by the sequential nature of electromyogram signal, we propose an attention-based hybrid CNN and RNN (CNN-RNN) architecture to better capture temporal properties of electromyogram signal for gesture recognition problem. Moreover, we present a new sEMG image representation method based on a traditional feature vector which enables deep learning architectures to extract implicit correlations between different channels for sparse multi-channel electromyogram signal. Extensive experiments on five sEMG benchmark databases show that the proposed method outperforms all reported state-of-the-art methods on both sparse multi-channel and high-density sEMG databases. To compare with the existing works, we set the window length to 200ms for NinaProDB1 and NinaProDB2, and 150ms for BioPatRec sub-database, CapgMyo sub-database, and csl-hdemg databases. The recognition accuracies of the aforementioned benchmark databases are 87.0%, 82.2%, 94.1%, 99.7% and 94.5%, which are 9.2%, 3.5%, 1.2%, 0.2% and 5.2% higher than the state-of-the-art performance, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Natural control methods based on surface electromyography (sEMG) and pattern recognition are promising for hand prosthetics. However, the control robustness offered by scientific research is still not sufficient for many real life applications, and commercial prostheses are capable of offering natural control for only a few movements. In recent years deep learning revolutionized several fields of machine learning, including computer vision and speech recognition. Our objective is to test its methods for natural control of robotic hands via sEMG using a large number of intact subjects and amputees. We tested convolutional networks for the classification of an average of 50 hand movements in 67 intact subjects and 11 transradial amputees. The simple architecture of the neural network allowed to make several tests in order to evaluate the effect of pre-processing, layer architecture, data augmentation and optimization. The classification results are compared with a set of classical classification methods applied on the same datasets. The classification accuracy obtained with convolutional neural networks using the proposed architecture is higher than the average results obtained with the classical classification methods, but lower than the results obtained with the best reference methods in our tests. The results show that convolutional neural networks with a very simple architecture can produce accurate results comparable to the average classical classification methods. They show that several factors (including pre-processing, the architecture of the net and the optimization parameters) can be fundamental for the analysis of sEMG data. Larger networks can achieve higher accuracy on computer vision and object recognition tasks. This fact suggests that it may be interesting to evaluate if larger networks can increase sEMG classification accuracy too.",

        "abstract": "Gesture interaction via surface electromyography (sEMG) signal is a promising approach for advanced human-computer interaction systems. However, improving the performance of the myoelectric interface is challenging due to the domain shift caused by the signal\u2019s inherent variability. To enhance the interface\u2019s robustness, we propose a novel adaptive information fusion neural network (AIFNN) framework, which could effectively reduce the effects of multiple scenarios. Specifically, domain adversarial training is established to inhibit the shared network\u2019s weights from exploiting domain-specific representation, thus allowing for the extraction of domain-invariant features. Effectively, classification loss, domain diversence loss and domain discrimination loss are employed, which improve classification performance while reduce distribution mismatches between the two domains. To simulate the application of myoelectric interface, experiments were carried out involving three scenarios (intra-session, inter-session and inter-subject scenarios). Ten non-disabled subjects were recruited to perform sixteen gestures for ten consecutive days. The experimental results indicated that the performance of AIFNN was better than two other state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches, namely fine-tuning (FT) and domain adversarial network (DANN). This study demonstrates the capability of AIFNN to maintain robustness over time and generalize across users in practical myoelectric interface implementations. These findings could serve as a foundation for future deployments.",

        "abstract": "To develop multi-functionalhuman-machine interfaces that can help disabled people reconstruct lost functions of upper-limbs, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been widely implemented to decode human movement intentions from surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. However, due to the high complexity of upper-limb movements and the inherent non-stable characteristics of sEMG, the usability of ML/DL based control schemes is still greatly limited in practical scenarios. To this end, tremendous efforts have been made to improve model robustness, adaptation, and reliability. In this article, we provide a systematic review on recent achievements, mainly from three categories: multi-modal sensing fusion to gain additional information of the user, transfer learning (TL) methods to eliminate domain shift impacts on estimation models, and post-processing approaches to obtain more reliable outcomes. Special attention is given to fusion strategies, deep TL frameworks, and confidence estimation. Research challenges and emerging opportunities, with respect to hardware development, public resources, and decoding strategies, are also analysed to provide perspectives for future developments",

While early work focused mainly on medical applications, there has been growing interest in utilizing sEMG as a sensing modality to enable next-generation, high-bandwidth, and natural human-machine interfaces. In the first part of this review, we briefly overview the human skeletomuscular physiology that gives rise to sEMG signals followed by a review of developments in sEMG acquisition hardware. Special attention is paid towards the fidelity of these devices as well as form factor, as recent advances have pushed the limits of user comfort and high-bandwidth acquisition. In the second half of the article, we explore work quantifying the information content of natural human gestures and then review the various signal processing and machine learning methods developed to extract information in sEMG signals. Finally, we discuss the future outlook in this field, highlighting the key gaps in current methods to enable seamless natural interactions between humans and machines.",

However, the lack of robustness and adaptability hinders its practical application. To realize the long-term reliability and user adaptability simultaneously, a novel multi-task dual-stream supervised domain adaptation (MDSDA) network based on convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed. A long-term multi-subject sEMG signal acquisition was conducted to validate the performance of MDSDA, recruiting 12 able-bodied subjects. A total of thirty gestures were used for the acquisition, including one set of static gestures and two sets of dynamic gestures. The long-term multi-subject sEMG dataset is publicly available at the website. Four train-test estimations were designed to evaluate the robustness and adaptability of MDSDA. The results showed that MDSDA outperformed CNN and fune-tuning. Furthermore, we studied the divisibility between static and dynamic gestures that performed similar actions. The outcomes demonstrated that there existed high separability between them. This may be helpful to reduce the signal collection burden. Experimental results proved MDSDA has the potential to provide a robust and generalized PR system for the clinic applications.",
